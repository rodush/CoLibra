This is an internal project made as a part of personal professional growth of Roman Dushko
while cooperating with Cogniance company.

The aim of the Project "CoLibra" is to build an Android client for internal company's library
(printed books for public use).

The first _*Alpha*_ version of the application supposed to be released to the end of 4th quarter of 2011 year,
unfortunately because of lack of time the development very slow and still not finished...

Moreover, seems that the future development will be frozen for an undefined period of time....

TODO:
Use: http://static.springsource.org/spring-android/docs/1.0.x/reference/htmlsingle/#rest-template
Spring REST module for Android, instead of using HttpClient, GSON as separated libs.
